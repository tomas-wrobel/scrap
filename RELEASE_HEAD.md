# Scrap

Introducing Scrap, a revolutionary visual programming editor designed for creators of all levels. Much like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), Scrap provides an intuitive interface for building interactive projects through block-based coding. However, Scrap takes it a step further by seamlessly integrating [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), empowering users to leverage the flexibility and power of a full-fledged programming language. Whether you're a beginner exploring the basics of coding or an experienced developer seeking a more accessible way to prototype ideas, Scrap is your ultimate tool for bringing creativity to life.
