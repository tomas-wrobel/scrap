## Introduction

Scratch is an excellent platform for beginners to get started with programming, thanks to its visual drag-and-drop interface. However, transitioning from Scratch to text-based languages like JavaScript can be intimidating. Scrap aims to ease this transition by providing a set of tools, resources, and utilities that help Scratch users grasp the concepts of JavaScript more easily.

## Features

- **No VM or Interpreter** - Scrap is a pure JavaScript application that runs in your web browser. Unlike Scratch, it doesn't require any VM or interpreter to run your code. The engine is powered by [BlockLike.js](https://blocklike.org), a JavaScript library that allows you to write Scratch-like code in JavaScript.

- **Block-Based Interface** - Scrap's interface is block-based, just like Scratch. This makes it easier for Scratch users to get started with Scrap. The block-based interface is powered by [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).

- **Text-Based Code Editor** - Scrap features a text-based code editor that allows you to write JavaScript code. The code editor is a subject of ongoing development, and more features will be added in the future.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Scrap, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tomas-wrobel/scrap.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd scrap`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage

After installing the required dependencies, you can launch the Scrap interactive environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open up a local development server where you can access the Scrap interface using your web browser.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from the community to make Scrap even better. If you're interested in contributing, please refer to my [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information on how to get involved.

## Scrap Logo Explanation

The logo for Scrap shares a visual resemblance with the Scratch logo as a deliberate homage. Here's what you need to know:

- **Font Choice**: Scrap uses the "Black Boys on Moped" font, the same as Scratch's logo, which is freeware and freely usable.

- **No Copyright Infringement**: Scrap respects copyright laws and does not infringe on Scratch's intellectual property. The similarity is a tribute, not a copy.

- **Non-Commercial**: Scrap is a non-commercial project, and its logo is used to recognize Scratch's influence on its mission to help beginners transition from Scratch to JavaScript.

In essence, Scrap's logo is a respectful tribute to Scratch, complying with legal and ethical standards.

## License
