## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Sprite adding
- Sprite bar layout

### Changed

- sw.js â†’ sw.ts
- dependencies update

## [5.0.0] - 2024-7-3

### Added

- The ability to resize the stage:
    - the `Hidden` tab component:
        - it shows as stripes showing new size in format `width x height`
        - after resizing, component will revert to the original component
    - New blocks - `width` and `height`:
        - Scrap Engine supports fitting the stage to the new size
        - width / height can report for both sprites and the stage
    - Fullscreen support in the Scrap IDE
- Header license comment in all TypeScript and Sass files

### Changed

- Exporting:
    - Exported HTML is minified
    - Export is named after the project name
    - HTML export includes iframe with dimensions like in the editor
- File structure:
    - `app` folder gets splitted:
        - `index.ts` lives in the `src` folder as `app.ts`
        - SVG files are now in the `svgs` folder
        - `style.scss` gets splitted into files inside `src/scss` folder
    - New glob typing files `*.d.ts` (literally with asterisk) files replace `index.js` files in:
        - `src/blockly/blocks` 
        - `src/blockly/fields`
        - `src/blockly/extensions`
    - Angle field now lives in `src/blockly/fields` folder (it was removed from Blockly core)
- Monaco Editor:
    - Reporting advanced syntax (e.g. OOP) via diagnostics, not only highlighting
    - Highlighted banned words: 
        - null and undefined removed - they are standalone keywords, so the diagnostics does better job
        - added `class` and `extends` - they are a part of a bigger structure (class)
    - Editing Microsoft's comments in `src/monaco-editor` to match Scrap's style
- Scrap Engine, **Blockly**  and other dependencies **update**

### Fixed

- `function` block no longer generates hidden `typed` block:
    - those took place on the generated code, and threw an error
